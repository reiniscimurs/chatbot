                  "An analysis published by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in March 2023 indicates that synthetic fuels will remain scarce for a long time: E-fuels are not yet commercially available. Currently, there are only a very few demonstration facilities worldwide. "
                  "By 2035, around 60 new e-fuel projects have been announced, of which only about 1% have a final investment decision secured. "
                  "Altogether, these global projects would meet only about 10% of Germany’s indispensable e-fuel requirements (especially for other transportation modes, such as ships and airplanes)."

This is according to an analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. To date, e-fuels—intended to be converted from wind or solar energy into synthetic hydrocarbons—are not yet produced commercially. "
                  "There are currently only a few research and pilot facilities. In their analysis, researchers also examined a scenario in which e-fuels develop similarly to photovoltaics, which has so far been the growth champion among energy technologies, with annual growth rates of 40 to 70 percent. Even then, it would only cover half of the indispensable demand. "

    "You inform the user about:How much e-fuel will be available in the near future? It depends on producing e-fuels in regions of the world where sunshine and wind are available more continuously and intensively than, for example, in Central Europe. "
    "The amount of electricity generated from sun, wind, and water in Germany varies significantly—under ideal conditions, more renewable energy is already being produced than can currently be consumed. "
    "In these situations, efficiency is less important than ensuring that the energy doesn’t go unused. The current debate focuses on which end uses make sense for storage solutions such as stationary batteries, gaseous hydrogen, or a liquid energy carrier. "
    "When it comes to transporting energy over long distances, liquid energy carriers have a clear advantage."
