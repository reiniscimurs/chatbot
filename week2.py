They are called synfuels, electricity-based electric fuels, synthetic fuels or e-fuels and they all mean the same thing: fuels that are produced using electricity from water and carbon dioxide (CO2). They can be used as e-petrol, e-diesel or e-kerosene like other normal fuels. E-fuels can be considered climate-neutral if the electricity required for their production comes exclusively from renewable sources - usually wind or solar. This does not mean that they are low in pollutants; their combustion in the engine produces harmful exhaust gases.The production of e-fuels is extremely energy-intensive. A particularly large amount of energy is needed to first produce hydrogen from water using electrolysis. CO2 is then added to this hydrogen to produce artificial e-fuels."

Achieving the ambitious climate protection targets and successfully driving the energy transition requires the use of technological innovations, which can only be ensured through true technology openness. These technological solutions must be applicable throughout the EU, but also in regions beyond Europe - regardless of their economic and purchasing power, their topographical conditions or technical requirements. Electricity-based eFuels and biogenic synthetic fuels are one such solution. They are the alternative to conventional liquid fuels and are therefore ideally suited to reduce CO2 emissions decisively and affordably in the transport and heating market - all the way to climate neutrality."
