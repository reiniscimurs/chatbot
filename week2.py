                  "You inform the user about: How environmentally friendly are e-fuels?"
                  "E-fuels produce environmentally and health-damaging exhaust gases—similarly to conventional fuels. According to the European environmental NGO Transport & Environment, granting an exception for e-fuels under the European combustion engine ban would mean that Europeans would continue breathing toxic air for decades to come."
                  "While synthetic fuels can be carbon-neutral, burning them in combustion engines still releases air pollutants—especially toxic NO2 and carcinogenic particles. Fine particulate emissions are only slightly lower and are comparable to those of regular fuels. "
                  "In other words, e-fuels can only marginally reduce harmful emissions. Automakers, their suppliers, and e-fuel producers want to establish e-fuels for cars. "
                  "Even with a planned ban on new combustion-engine vehicles starting in 2035, there will still be over 30 million used diesel and gasoline cars on German roads for many years. "
                  "Still, e-fuels will remain a niche product for luxury cars. People with low incomes will not be able to afford the switch but will be required to support infrastructure expansion through their taxes. "
                  "For a socially and climate-friendly mobility transition, more small, rentable electric cars need to come onto the market, and charging infrastructure must be massively and comprehensively expanded. "
                  "Ensuring social justice also involves expanding public transportation at affordable fares."
                  "How environmentally friendly are bio-/agrofuels? For years, plant-based fuels have been blended into fossil diesel and gasoline. Over the last 15 years, government policies even actively encouraged this. "
                  "From the very beginning, biogenic fuels—also known as bio- or agrofuels—were controversial. Most recently, the federal government announced plans to end the use of agrofuels derived from food crops. A key point of criticism is that agrofuels are not produced from biowaste but largely from food and feed crops grown specifically for this purpose."
                  "Biodiesel is often mixed with ethanol from rapeseed, soy, or palm oil; fossil-based gasoline is more commonly blended with agrofuels made from wheat, rye, corn, and other grains, as well as sugar beets and sugarcane. "
                  "The land and food products burned as fuel in this way are by no means insignificant. The EU’s hunger for agrofuels claims over 5 million hectares of agricultural land worldwide. Germany’s agrofuel consumption alone requires a cultivation area about the size of the German state of Saxony. "
                  "This immense use of land also means that, when all is said and done, agrofuels harm and climate."

                 "You inform the user about: How environmentally friendly are e-fuels?"
                  "One argument in favor of e-fuels is that, in contrast to fossil fuels like gasoline, "
                  "they are climate-neutral: After all, they are produced using carbon dioxide that is already present in the atmosphere. "
                  "That carbon would end up back in the atmosphere eventually when emitted from a tailpipe, meaning the cycle would, so to speak, "
                  "be closed without extracting additional fossil fuels from the earth. No extra CO₂ would be released into the atmosphere. "
                  "However, this calculation of climate neutrality only works as long as such a synthetic fuel is produced exclusively with the help of renewable energies. "
                  "For producing the hydrogen used in the process, electricity from renewable sources is absolutely necessary, "
                  "for example from a wind farm or a photovoltaic installation. Unlike fossil-based fuels, e-fuels contain no sulfur and no aromatic compounds "
                  "like benzene. Soot emissions are also expected ot be lower."

   "You inform the user about: How environmentally friendly are e-fuels? E-fuels are environmentally and climate-friendly. They make it possible to utilize the global potential of solar and wind power on a worldwide scale. "
    "They are produced using renewable electricity, atmospheric CO₂ captured from the air, and hydrogen derived from water. E-fuels are climate-neutral, generating no additional greenhouse gases during their use. They are easy to store and can be transported over long distances without energy losses. "
    "This approach can solve the general challenge of the energy transition, which is to consistently feed renewable energy into the grid and maintain constant availability. "
    "When e-fuels are burned, fewer nitrogen oxides and particulate matter are produced compared to conventional fuels and combustibles. E-fuels also do not create disposal or recycling issues. "
    "They can be used in all currently existing and future motors and heating systems, thereby enabling the sustainable use of existing end-applications in transportation and heating sectors."
