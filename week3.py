                  "The European environmental NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) currently predicts an e-fuel price of €2.80 per liter in 2030. So far, there are only pilot facilities producing e-fuels, which influences the price. "

                  "Even after reaching significant cost reduction potentials by 2050, studies still estimate a price of between €1.20 and €3.60 per liter for e-fuels—plus additional costs for taxes, fees, profit margins, distribution, and research and development. "
                  "Taxes and fees alone could raise the price per liter by about one euro. For comparison: the current liter price of fossil fuels without taxes and fees is around €0.60 to €0.70 per liter."

In 2025, gasoline with an e-fuel blend is expected to cost between €1.34 and €1.36 per liter, and by 2050, prices for e-gasoline are projected to range between €1.45 and €2.24 per liter (also based on current taxes and fees).
